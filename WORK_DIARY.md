## Work Diary

### Day 1
We discussed how we should outline this project and what kind of design we should go for.
We decided that we will favour integration tests over e2e tests.

Team will be using argocd for Continuous Deployment and github actions for CI and Continuous Delivery.

### Day 2

Added some basic unit and integration tests.
Added .dockerignore file, .gitignore file.
Added pytest.ini for test and coverage configuration.
Added pre-commit configuration and also pylint
